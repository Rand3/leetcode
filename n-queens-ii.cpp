	* 'limit' is all '1's.
	* 'h'  is the bits all the queens vertically projected on a row. If h==limit, then it's done, answer++.
	* 'r'  is the bits all the queens anti-diagonally projected on a row.
	* 'l'  is the bits all the queens diagonally projected on a row.
	* h|r|l  is all the occupied bits. Then pos = limit & (~(h|r|l)) is all the free positions.
	* p = pos & (-pos)  gives the right most '1'. pos -= p means we will place a queen on this bit
	*             represented by p.
	* 'h+p'  means one more queue vertically projected on next row.
	* '(r+p)<<1'  means one more queue anti-diagonally projected on next row. Because we are
	*             moving to next row and the projection is skew from right to left, we have to
	*             shift left one position after moved to next row.
	* '(l+p)>>1'  means one more queue diagonally projected on next row. Because we are
	*             moving to next row and the projection is skew from left to right, we have to
	*             shift right one position after moved to next row.
